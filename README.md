# Sales-Intelligence-Forecasting-Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **sales analytics and forecasting platform** designed to transform raw retail transaction data into meaningful business insights and future sales predictions.

The goal of this project is to simulate a **real-world enterprise data workflow**, covering:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Structured storage using SQL
- Analytical insights
- Machine learning–based forecasting
- Interactive business dashboards

The project is built incrementally, following **industry best practices** used in large organizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a clean and reproducible **data pipeline**
- Analyze historical sales trends and customer behavior
- Segment customers based on purchasing patterns
- Forecast future sales using machine learning models
- Present insights through **interactive Tableau dashboards**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Visualization:** Tableau  
- **Cloud:** AWS (S3, EC2)  
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (planned)

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Online Retail Dataset (Kaggle)**

The dataset contains transactional data from an online retail store, including:
- Invoice number  
- Product details  
- Quantity and unit price  
- Transaction date  
- Customer ID  
- Country  

It consists of **~542,000 records** and includes real-world challenges such as missing values and returns, making it suitable for realistic data engineering and analytics workflows.
